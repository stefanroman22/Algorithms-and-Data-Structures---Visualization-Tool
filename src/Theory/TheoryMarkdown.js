# Graphs

Graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of **vertices (nodes)** and **edges**.  
*Include picture of graph later*

A **vertex**, also called a **node**, is a point or an object in the Graph, and an **edge** is used to connect two vertices with each other.

Graphs are non-linear because the data structure allows us to have different paths to get from one vertex to another, unlike linear data structures like Arrays or Linked Lists.

Graphs are used to represent and solve problems where the data consists of objects and relationships between them, such as:

- **Social Networks**: Each person is a vertex, and relationships (like friendships) are the edges. Algorithms can suggest potential friends.
- **Maps and Navigation**: Locations, like a town or bus stops, are stored as vertices, and roads are stored as edges. Algorithms can find the shortest route between two locations when stored as a Graph.
- **Internet**: Can be represented as a Graph, with web pages as vertices and hyperlinks as edges.
- **Biology**: Graphs can model systems like neural networks or the spread of diseases.
